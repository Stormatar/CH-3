            <!-- 1st paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to explain the importance of using descriptive file names for image files. Use complete sentences. -->
            <p>Its important to use descriptive file names. Without them it would be very hard to keep track of whats happening</p>
            
            <!-- 2nd paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to identify the application you used to change the size of the image. Use a complete sentence. -->
            <p>I used microsoft paint to change the size of the image.</p>
            
            <!-- 3rd paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to identify the original size of the image, in pixels. Use a complete sentence. -->
            <p>it was originally 2121x1414</p>
            
            <h4>Image Before Compression</h4>
            <!-- Use image element below to insert the image before compression, html5.jpg -->
            <img src="C:/Users/storm/OneDrive/Documents/CH-3/extend/Images/html5.jpg" alt="Uncompressed image" width="450" height="326">   &nbsp; &#9632; &nbsp;
            
            <!-- 4th paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to identify the online image compressor you used to reduce the file size. What was the original image file size? What was the reduced image file size? Use complete sentences.  -->
            <p>I used compressor.io to compress the image. It was originally 10mb afterwords it was 7kb</p>
            
            <h4>Image After Compression</h4>
            <!-- Use image element below to insert the image after compression, html5_min.jpg -->
            <img src="C:/Users/storm/OneDrive/Documents/CH-3/extend/Images/html5min.jpg" alt="Compressed image" width="450" height="326">   &nbsp; &#9632; &nbsp;
            
            <!-- 5th paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to note any visual changes that you can see between html5.jpg and html5_min.jpg -->
            <p>the second image is far smaller then the first thou at the cost of the visual quality of the image</p>
